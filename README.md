Open API project for Code the Dream 
[My Open API Project] (https://github.com/luz-saldana/cat-api)

Welcome to my "it's all about cats" project! 

How to use? 

First: try to either download the project or run it locally in your computer. 

Next:
--> You'll be directed to the "Home" page (the "It's all about cats!" page) where you'll type in a cat behavior you can think of (curious, calm, independent, active, etc), and you'll get a random image of a cat with that specific behavior and others! Plus their breed name. Very simple!

--> There's another page that will take you to the "Collage" section. All you gotta do is click the navigation link at the top and then it will take you to the "Cat Collage" page where you'll see your randomly generated cat collage. Fun! You can refresh to get a different collage with different images.
